var games= ["Football", "Tennis", "Cricket"]

for (let index = 0; index < games.length; index++) {
    const element = games[index];
    console.log(element)
}



Possible all errors: 
1. [] missing in first line while declaring games array
2. in for loop statement games.length() is wrong it should be games.length
3. in for loop cost array[index] is wrong it should be games[index]
4. console(element) should be console.log(element)
